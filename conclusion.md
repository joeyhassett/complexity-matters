Conclude:
- Does it really matter that you can get a slightly faster machine if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?
- Does it really matter that you can gain a factor of 100 if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?

As displayed by the graphs, even if you gain a factor of 100, if you can get a lower BigOh complexity it will not really matter. Additionally, it will not really matter if you can get a slightly faster machine if you can get a lower BigOh complexity. The 10^4 n plot being included in all three tasks helps to demonstrate that the runtimes will correlate with the n-values across each graph. Regardless of the higher factors, a lower BigOh complexity will help to decrease the runtime for values of n.
