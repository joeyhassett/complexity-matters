# Complexity Matters
Project 1 - Glebova CSC 2510

Goal:
The purpose of this assignment is to understand why algorithms are judged by their Big-Oh notations rather than a more precise model, or runtime measurement

Programming Part
Task 1:
Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for problem size ranging from 1 to 105. (Don't use all values of n, take some values in the middle.)
- 104 n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
- 5.104 n instructions on a machine at 1MHz
- 102 n2 instruction on a machine at 100MHz

Task 2:
Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for problem size ranging from 1 to 104. (Don't use all values of n, take some values in the middle.)
- 104 n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
- 102 n2 instructions on a machine at 100MHz
- n4 instructions on a machine at 10GHz

Task 3:
Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for problem size ranging from 1 to 102. (Don't use all values of n, take some values in the middle.)
- 104 n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
- 102 n2 instructions on a machine at 100MHz
- n4 instructions on a machine at 10GHz
- 2n instruction on a machine at 1PHz

Conclude:
- Does it really matter that you can get a slightly faster machine if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?
- Does it really matter that you can gain a factor of 100 if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?
